This is a 2.4% increase from the December forecast of 223.14 million boxes, but a decrease of 1.7% from the season's initial orange estimate that was released in May. Brazil production is forecast up 9% to 1 million tons. Exports are up. Brazil is by far the largest OJ producer and is projected to account for three-quarters of global OJ exports. Mexico production is projected to increase 4% to 187,000 tons. Exports are up, with the United States expected to remain the top export market. United States ... Not even a decrease of exports in the 2024/25 season will be enough to compensate for the reduction in the volume of fruit processed, which will maintain the demand from the industry at high levels. Moreover, Florida has been registering a decrease in inventories and may need to import more inputs from Brazil, which helps to sustain quotations ... Despite this decrease, Brazil's production is anticipated to recover slightly from the current season, which was the lowest since 1988. Post forecasts orange weight at 160 grams/5.64 ounces in MY 2024/25, three percent lighter than Post's previous estimate of 165 grams for MY 2023/24 due to adverse weather conditions. As the world's largest exporter of orange juice, Brazil has driven a steep drop in the commodity's prices‚Äîcutting futures by 50% so far this year alone.
